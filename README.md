Savana is a simple Agile Customer Collaboration tool based on Taiga for small digital, and media production companies.
It provides an integrated Agile project management tool (see Taiga project) and a ticketing management system to support fast delivery and fast feedback 
for your customers on video and audio projects.


### Why Savana ###
It started, as usual, from some personal experiences in managing change/feature requests by customers and from Agile Manifesto: << Customer collaboration over contract negotiation >>


### License ###
Savana inherits the AGPL v3.0 Licence from Taiga project.
Every code patch accepted in taiga codebase is licensed under AGPL v3.0. You must be careful to not include any code that can not be licensed under this license.
